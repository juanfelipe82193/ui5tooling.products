# portal-cf-content-deployer

Portal CF Content Deployer
This component is used to deploy the Fiori Launchpad portal site configuration (configuration of tiles, groups and catalogs) into the Cloud Foundry Environment.
This component interacts with the portal service and the approuter, which in turn acts as the web entry server of the Fiori Launchpad portal site.
